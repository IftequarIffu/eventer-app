## Things Learnt in this project

- To create the hover effect for links in the navbar, you can do something like `text-white/50 hover:text-white transition`. `text-white/50` means white color text with 50% opacity. **Check Navbar**
- `tracking-tight` classname of tailwind is used for titles on the main page. It makes it look much better
- Use `opacity-50` or `opacity-75` for sub headings. **Check Navbar**
- Mention the website theme colors in the tailwind config file and use them as `bg-primary` or `text-primary` etc.
- Use `usePathName()` hook to get the current path of the page. Eg: `/events/all`
