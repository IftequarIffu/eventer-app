## Things Learnt in this project

- To create the hover effect for links in the navbar, you can do something like `text-white/50 hover:text-white transition`. `text-white/50` means white color text with 50% opacity.
- `tracking-tight` classname of tailwind is used for titles on the main page. It makes it look much better
- Use `opacity-50` or `opacity-75` for sub headings.
